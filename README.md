# What is VEngine?
This project powers the *"VN Machine"*, A TV connected to my PC that I use to play visual novels.

It works by switching between two configurations
- Desktop Mode (2 Desktop displays & Headset audio output)
- VN Mode (TV display & TV audio output)

When switching modes it attaches the appropriate displays and switches primary audio output device.
The project however is modular and allows defining your own configurations.
